# NodeJS TypeScript Starter KitðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–

A TypeScript project template to get the ball rolling and straight into development!\
No more fuss about following tutorials and articles on how to setup a TypeScript dev environment, use this template to speed that slow "Getting things ready" phase.\
Happy Coding!!âš¡âš¡

## NPM Scripts

`npm start`
 - Executes npm run build and then runs index.js in build folder.\
 \
`npm run start:dev`
 - Starts a nodemon instance that restarts typescript when updates are created.\
 \
`npm run build`
 - Compiles TypeScript code into JavaScript under a new build folder in the working directory. If a build folder already exists then it is deleted.\
 \
`npm run test`
 - Echoes that no test is currently specified and exits with status code 1. Use this command for future testing purposes.\
